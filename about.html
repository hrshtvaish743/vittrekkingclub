                    <h2>About VIT Trekking Club</h2>
                    <p>The VIT Trekking Club was founded on 9th July, 2010 by a group of enthusiastic individuals who wanted more out of life in college other than sitting glued in front of a laptop screen and increasing their chances of obesity and a horde of other problems related to lack of exercise, wrong body posture, eye strain; the list is nearly endless. There were initially very less number of people and the strength and determination has increased manifold ever since.</p>
                    <p>It is one of a kind. We are what many would call “adventure freaks”. Our so-called “excursions” usually involve hair-raising risks and often cause a skinned knee or a twisted ankle. And yet, this is what gives us motivation. We strive to bring about the spirit of adventure amongst the students of VIT and the need to take them away from their laptops and gizmos for a while to marvel at how breathtaking Mother Nature can be.</p>
                    <p>The Trekking club has gone on several trips to various places for rock climbing, hiking, hill climbing and we are always on the lookout for new places. Each trip is a new experience and teaches us how to adapt to the surroundings and face new challenges.</p>
                    <p>As the club has been formed quite recently, the club has a small, but very enthusiastic group of people in it. Each member has his or her own part to play in making the club better and praiseworthy.</p>
                    <p>As per our motto, we are on the constant lookout for potential adventure. Our club is even a part of teaching over 100 students about the adventures and benefits of trekking, which enables us to take various new faces to the world of trek and give them a platform where they can learn more about adventurous activities like rappelling, rafting, hiking, mountaineering and various others.</p>
                    <p>So far we have emerged to be the most famous in club in VIT, whether be it offline or online media and yet we aim to reach new heights of success which no one has yet achieved. We constantly thrive to achieve this goal through conducting various indoor as well as outdoor activities; some of them are namely, Trek-quizition, TREK gyan , spotting, sanitation drive to Amrithi Forest.</p>
                    <p>We even have connections with various other organizations, who are like-minded as us and aim to teach and help people through fun activities, like stay clean, teach all and others. We are always on the hunt for more such people who can help us to help others and thus increase the number of lives in which we can bring a positive change</p>
